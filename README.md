# User-Auth-System-Backend

<h2>This is the most secure authentication system for login and signup and also has a password reset mechanism.</h2>

You had to add your own API and need to set some .env variables and also need to install few NPM modules.

<p>Just install this backend and configure it with your frontend.</p>

<b>I asked you to make a more secure function in this file. <b/>
